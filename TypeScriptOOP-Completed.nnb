                "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the organization and manipulation of data as objects, rather than simply processing logic or functions. Good OOP practices involve designing reusable and extensible code by creating classes, interfaces, and abstract classes.\n\nWhile some programming languages like Java are purely OOP, others like Typescript combine OOP principles with scripting capabilities. In OOP, a model is designed to represent a real-life entity, and then that model is used to create different but similar objects. For example, a Car can be considered a model that defines the properties and behaviors of a generic car, and a specific car like a Ford Ranger can be an instance of that model that behaves like all other cars but may have its own unique characteristics."

                "Access Control keywords are used in many languages, and TypeScript uses the most common three `public`, `protected`, `private`.  These access modifiers tell the computer what can access and modify the property/method.\n\n`public` -- this property is available  anywhere.  If no access modifier is used, the property defaults to public\n\n`protected` -- this property can be used within the class and within the derived classes, but not from outside the class\n\n`private`  -- this property can only be used from within the class that declared it.\n\nThese access modifiers are the key to a concept known and <b>encapsulation</b>. This is basically the idea of data hiding to prevent properties from being modified or used by people/programs that it shouldn't be used by, or to control the modifications of these properties."

                "Let's redefine our Ducks now using Interfaces. Interfaces are generally names with the suffix `able` because the Interface says anything that implements me is able to do these actions.\n\nInterfaces also work with Polymorphism. \n\nTo say a class uses an interface we use the keyword `implements`\n\nA class can implement many interfaces, yet extend only one class.\n\nAn Interface can enforce many different methods/properties, but in this example we will keep it to one method per interface.  The Age property should belong to all ducks still, so we will keep the Duck base class to hold the age, for these examples we will assume the ducks all age exactly the same, so there will be no need to override the getters for age.\n\n<i>Interface vs Type</i>\n\nInterfaces and Types are extremely similar in TypeScript and for the most part Interfaces and Types can be used interchangeably in TypeScript.\n\nfor an in-depth discussion on the differences visit https://www.educba.com/typescript-type-vs-interface/\n\nInterfaces are created to say this class will work with anything that needs this interface.  You can think of a CD as an interface.  There are tons of different CDs with different information on them, but they can all be put into a CD player to play there contents.  The CD is an interface that works with a CD Player then different artists can use the CD interface to create there own CDs filled with their own music.\n\n\n<strong>Note </strong> Interfaces do not have method bodies (Abstract classes have method bodies)"

Lets now assume a mallard and redheaded duck both quack and fly and swim the same and most ducks will have the same sort of flying and quacking and swimming mechanism.  Decoy ducks still fly, quack, and swim differently.  \n\nNow we are tasked with creating a Rubber Ducky.  A Rubber ducky will not be able to fly like our Decoy Duck, It will quack in its own squeaky way, and it will swim like the Decoy duck by floating.\n\nThis is our final iteration of this Duck Design"
